Network Issues Troubleshooting Guide

PURPOSE:
Systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving network connectivity issues.

COMMON NETWORK PROBLEMS:

1. NO INTERNET CONNECTION:
   Symptoms: Cannot access websites, email not syncing, cloud services unavailable
   
   Basic Troubleshooting Steps:
   - Check physical cable connections (Ethernet)
   - Verify WiFi connection status and signal strength
   - Restart network adapter (disable/enable)
   - Restart computer
   - Test with different device on same network
   - Check with other employees for widespread issues

   Advanced Steps:
   - Release and renew IP address (ipconfig /release, ipconfig /renew)
   - Flush DNS cache (ipconfig /flushdns)
   - Reset network stack (netsh winsock reset)
   - Update network drivers
   - Check proxy settings

2. SLOW NETWORK PERFORMANCE:
   Symptoms: Web pages load slowly, file transfers take long time, video calls lag
   
   Diagnostic Steps:
   - Run speed test (speedtest.net)
   - Check bandwidth usage by other applications
   - Test wired vs wireless connection
   - Check for background updates/uploads
   - Verify QoS settings
   - Monitor network utilization

3. INTERMITTENT CONNECTIVITY:
   Symptoms: Connection drops randomly, websites timeout occasionally
   
   Investigation Steps:
   - Check event logs for network errors
   - Monitor connection stability over time
   - Test during different times of day
   - Check for interference (WiFi)
   - Verify cable integrity
   - Review DHCP lease times

4. VPN CONNECTION ISSUES:
   Symptoms: Cannot connect to VPN, frequent disconnections, slow VPN performance
   
   Resolution Steps:
   - Verify VPN credentials
   - Check VPN server status
   - Try different VPN servers/protocols
   - Disable firewall temporarily for testing
   - Update VPN client software
   - Check for conflicting network software

NETWORK SECURITY PROTOCOLS:
- Always verify user identity before providing network access
- Do not share WiFi passwords via insecure channels
- Report suspicious network activity immediately
- Maintain logs of all network configuration changes
- Follow change management procedures for network modifications

MONITORING AND PREVENTION:
- Regular network performance monitoring
- Proactive cable testing and replacement
- Firmware updates for network equipment

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:
- Document all troubleshooting steps taken
- Escalate to network team if basic steps fail
- Provide temporary workarounds when possible
- Communicate expected resolution times to users
- Follow up to ensure issue is fully resolved
