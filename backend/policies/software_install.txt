Software Installation Guide and Best Practices

PURPOSE:
To provide guidance on software installation while ensuring security and system stability.

GENERAL SOFTWARE INSTALLATION STEPS:

1. BASIC INSTALLATION PROCESS:
   - Download software from official vendor website only
   - Verify digital signatures and authenticity
   - Close all unnecessary programs before installation
   - Run installer as administrator if required
   - Follow installation wizard prompts carefully
   - Choose custom installation to control installed components
   - Restart computer if prompted
   - Check for initial updates after installation

2. PRE-INSTALLATION CHECKLIST:
   - Verify system requirements (RAM, storage, OS version)
   - Check compatibility with existing software
   - Backup important data before major installations
   - Temporarily disable antivirus if installation fails
   - Ensure stable internet connection for downloads
   - Have product keys/licenses ready if required

3. COMMON INSTALLATION ISSUES:
   - "Access Denied" errors: Run as administrator
   - "Missing prerequisites": Install required frameworks (Visual C++, .NET)
   - Installation hangs: Check available disk space, disable conflicting software
   - "Corrupted installer": Re-download from official source
   - License errors: Verify product key and licensing terms

4. POST-INSTALLATION BEST PRACTICES:
   - Configure software settings for security and performance
   - Set up automatic updates if available
   - Register software if required
   - Remove installation files to free up space
   - Test core functionality before relying on software
   - Document license information for compliance
